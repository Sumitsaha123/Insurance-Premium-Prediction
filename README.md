# Insurance-Premium-Prediction
First ML Project end to end Implementation with Kaggle dataset

Following stapes have been followed to build the final model:
  1. Data collection from kaggle
  2. Data analysis and Visualization
  3. Data cleaning and Feature Engineering (In kaggle dataset there were 0 missing value)
  4. Model Selection with different different regression algorithm
  5. Hyper Parameter tuning with final model to increse accuracy
  6. Cross validation 
  7. Model Finalization
  8. Pickel File Creation 
  9. UI creation with Flask
  10. Backend proceesing in flask
  11. Freezing all the dependent libraries to generate 'Requirements.txt' file
  12. Deployed whole model in Hereku Platform
